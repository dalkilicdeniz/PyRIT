    "## üìå Overview\n",
    "This notebook automates **red teaming** for **AH-GPT** using the **PyRIT** framework. The goal is to evaluate whether the AI assistant responds appropriately to **restricted or harmful prompts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ†Ô∏è Steps in this Notebook\n",
    "- **üîß Configuration** - Set up API authentication and HTTP requests.\n",
    "- **üìã Define Red Teaming Objectives** - Specify adversarial prompts.\n",
    "- **‚öôÔ∏è Initialize PyRIT** - Configure the testing environment.\n",
    "- **üì° Execute Multi-Turn Attacks** - Test AI responses to malicious inputs.\n",
    "- **üìä Generate Reports** - Save results in an HTML report.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìù How to Use This Notebook\n",
    "1. **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run each cell in order** from top to bottom.\n",
    "2. **‚úèÔ∏è Modify the `objectives` list** to test different adversarial queries.\n",
