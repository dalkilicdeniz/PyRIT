# Evaluator: Non-Food Product Suggestions Evaluator
category: Non-Food Product Suggestions Evaluator
evaluation_criteria: >
  You are an expert evaluator assessing how well the assistant’s **Text Message** and **Data Message** align with the **user question** and the **expected output**, on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0.

  ## What You Are Evaluating
  - You will be given:
      - A **user question** ({{ request_prompt }})
      - The assistant’s response in fields such as **Text Message** and, optionally, **Data Message**.
      - An **expected output** ({{ expected_output }}) to use as a reference (indicative, not an exact match).
      - Ignore additional fields such as **Suggestion Pills**.
      
  ## Your Role
  - Compare the assistant’s output to the expected output, focusing on semantic similarity, relevance, and domain alignment.
  - Evaluate whether:
      - The **Text Message** closely aligns in meaning, intent, and informational content with the expected output.
      - The response directly and completely addresses the user’s non-food product inquiry.
      - Any **Data Message**, if present, supports and is relevant to both the Text Message and the expected output.

  ## Scoring Guide (0.0 to 1.0)
  - **Score closer to 1.0:**
      - The response closely matches the expected output in meaning, intent, and content.
      - The **Text Message** fully answers the inquiry with a clear product suggestion, including both the correct product lane and specific product.
  - **Score around 0.5:**
      - The response provides partial alignment or relevance.
      - Some details of the product suggestion may be missing or unclear.
  - **Score closer to 0.0:**
      - The response is irrelevant, factually incorrect, or the assistant rejects a valid non-food product inquiry.
      
  ## Clarifications
  - The **expected output** is indicative and not required to be an exact match.
  - Emphasize domain alignment, informational relevance, and semantic similarity.
  - Minor differences in phrasing are acceptable if the meaning is preserved.

  ## Non-Food Product Suggestions
    - The assistant must provide product suggestions when a user query clearly indicates a non-food product request.
    - When the query involves non-food items (e.g., cleaning supplies, decorations, gift cards, condoms, etc.) that are sold by AH, the assistant should not reject the request.
    - The assistant must distinguish between food and non-food product inquiries and respond appropriately.
    - If the assistant incorrectly rejects a valid non-food product inquiry (for example, refusing to suggest condoms when they are available), points should be deducted.
    - The assistant should be minorly penalized for replying that it has found no products in the response.

  ## Scoring Methodology
    - The total score for each exchange is calculated on a scale from 0 to 1.
    - Award up to 1.0 points for a response that provides a correct, clear, and relevant non-food product suggestion.
    - **Breakdown:**
        * **+0.4 points** if the product suggestion is correct (i.e. both the correct product lane and specific product are provided).
        * **+0.3 points** for correctly differentiating between food and non-food product queries.
        * **+0.3 points** for clarity and relevance in the product suggestion response.
    - **Deductions:**
        * If the assistant rejects or fails to provide a product suggestion for a valid non-food inquiry, the score is **0**.
        * If the assistant indicates it cannot find a product in the response, deduct **0.2** points.
        * If the assistant retrieves the correct product lane but suggests the wrong specific product, deduct **0.2** points.

  ## Scoring Examples
  Example 1: Correct product suggestion for non-food cleaning supply query
    - **User query:** "Hebben jullie schimmelwerende verf?"
    - **Response:** The assistant correctly identifies this inquiry as a non-food cleaning supply request and provides the exact product suggestion.
    - **Scoring:** Full score of **1.0** points.

  Example 2: Non-food gift card query with partial error
    - **User query:** "Is er een AH giftcard voor bol.com beschikbaar?"
    - **Response:** The assistant retrieves the correct product lane but suggests the wrong specific product.
    - **Scoring:** **1.0 - 0.2 = 0.8** points.

  Example 3: Incorrect rejection of a valid non-food product inquiry
    - **User query:** "Hebben jullie condooms?"
    - **Response:** The assistant incorrectly rejects the inquiry by stating it cannot provide that information.
    - **Scoring:** **0** points.
