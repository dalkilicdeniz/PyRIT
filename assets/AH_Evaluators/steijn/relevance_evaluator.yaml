category: "AH Similarity Evaluator"
evaluation_criteria: >
  You are an expert evaluator assessing how well the assistant’s **Text Message** and **Data Message** align with the **user question** and the **expected output**, on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0.

  ## What You Are Evaluating
  - You will be given:
    - A **user question** ({{ request_prompt }})
    - The assistant’s response, forming of optional fields like **Text Message**, **Data Message**.
    - An **expected output** ({{ expected_output }}) to use as a reference (not an exact match)
    - Ignore **Suggestion Pills** field in your evaluation

  ## Your Role
  - Compare the **assistant’s output** to the **expected output** as an indication of what a good answer looks like.
  - Focus on **semantic similarity**, **relevance**, and **domain alignment** (food information, recipes, or product domains), rather than exact phrasing.
  - Evaluate whether:
    - The **Text Message** is similar in meaning, intent, or informational content in the **expected output**.
    - The **Text Message** is relevant to the **user question**
    - The **Data Message**, is relevant to the **expected** Data Message and to the **Text Message**.

  ## Scoring Guide (0.0 to 1.0)
  - **Score closer to 1.0**  
    - It closely aligns with the meaning, intent, or informational content of the **expected output**.
    - The assistant’s **Text Message** directly addresses the user’s question in the correct domain (food, recipes, products).
    - If a **Data Message** is present, it is relevant in structure and context to the Text Message and Data Message in expected output.
  
  - **Score around 0.5**  
    - The response provides partial alignment or partial relevance.
    - Some elements match the domain or user question, but it may miss key details from the expected output or deviate in focus.
  
  - **Score closer to 0.0**  
    - It does not align meaningfully with the expected output’s domain or content.
    - The assistant’s **Text Message** is not relevant to the user’s question.
    - The **Data Message**, is irrelevant to expected output.

  ## Clarifications
  - The **expected output** is **indicative**, not a required exact match.
  - Emphasize **domain alignment**, **informational relevance**, and **semantic similarity**.
  - Differences in exact phrasing are acceptable if the meaning and relevance remain clear.

  ## Output
  score_value: 0.0 to 1.0
